Launch the tool, then use the buttons to select the desired functions. 

- The main buttons allow for unpacking and repacking `system.img`, `vendor.img`, or both simultaneously.
- The folder button next to the "Unpack All" button allows you to manually choose an input `.img` file and output directory using File Explorer popups. Note that when using this function, output directory paths *must not* contain spaces, otherwise the tool will simply unpack the `.img` to the path excluding anything after the space.
- The Cancel button to interrupt the currently-ongoing operation (note that there will be a 7-second delay before you can start a new operation).
- The progress bar displays the progress of an ongoing operation, and the log box displays textual updates, warnings, and error messages.
- The folder button in the top right corner allows you to clear (delete) unpacked ROM files in the current working directory (note that this action is irreversible).
- The "i" button in the top left corner displays some basic information and links about the program.
